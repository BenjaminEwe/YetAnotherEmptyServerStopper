## Function
This datapack works by checking if there are any players online every 5 minutes. If the server is empty, it adds one to a counter. If it has checked 4 times in a row and the server was empty all 4 times, it starts a shutdown of the server.
If any of the checks show a player is online, it resets the counter to 0.

## Important!
You must edit your server.properties file on your server to set ```function-permission-level=4```. If you do not do this, the datapack will not work.
